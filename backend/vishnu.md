vishnumolakala badarinadh: Hi. Hi Derek.
Derek Dicks: Hey, how's it going?
Evan Kubicek: Hi, listen.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Good. Good. How are you guys doing today?
Derek Dicks: Doing very good.
Evan Kubicek: Good
Derek Dicks: Good to meet you. Um, now just correct me. Vishnu is uh what's what's the best name to call you?
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Yeah, you can call me Vishnu.
Derek Dicks: Vishnu. Okay, very good. Very good. Well, good to have you. Um, I have possibly one other uh of our dev team that's gonna be coming in. Um, he's in the middle of some last minute rushing before we have a meeting in 30 minutes. So, we'll see if he makes it or not. Um, and then JD, I believe you know him already, correct?
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Oh yeah.
Derek Dicks: Josh. Okay. Uh, he ended up having a conflict as well, so he's not going to be free for a while. So, he most likely won't be coming either. So it might just be us three uh for this initial meeting which is totally fine.
 
 
00:00:54
 
Derek Dicks: Uh but just to give you expectation. Uh so Vishnu I am uh Derek uh JD and I uh had founded April Assist. Um I had started it for my own business with my wife a couple years ago. Uh just implementing AI chat uh for her business and just figuring out a bunch of stuff that was available then. Uh come a long way since then. got about six or seven different devs that we have on team now representing about five different countries and we brought in team Evan here. Have you met Evan already?
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Oh dear.
Evan Kubicek: No.
Derek Dicks: Okay. Okay. I I I don't know much coming into this meeting so I apologize if I ask questions like that often because I uh we'll get caught up here but uh bringing Evan in. He's um helping a lot with investment. uh he's our CRO but then he also helps with a lot of other um awesome things and you can share some stuff in a minute um but generally we have um been working on some pri proprietary stuff we've been using some thirdparty stuff um just to get to market quick and then go through and replace tools as we can um moving forward.
 
 
00:02:01
 
Derek Dicks: So, where we're at right now is um looking for just a full full rebuild and we've got most of it taken care of. Um but we were just looking to talk to some other talent and kind of see what they had to offer. So, maybe real quick on my side. Love to hear about you though.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Okay. So let me give a small introduction about myself so that you guys understand what are the uh tools and technologies I'm using uh in my current project and the previous projects. So I'm I'm Badinat Vishnamala. So I'm currently working at uh you know meta. I'm a cloud devops engineer. So with the three years of experience uh in the building and automating a large scale cloud infrastructure and like that and so you know my background and spans like end to end uh cloud cloud DevOps and I'm mostly working on the cloud on the AWS EC2 instances VP subnets and so I work in with containerization with the docker and kubernetes uh you know infrastructure as a code with the terapform and I also use working on the inible uh inible and sheet like that.
 
 
00:03:09
 
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So mostly I my current project also I worked on the CID automation using the GitHub actions and you know for the Jenkins and digital devops. So I built the multi cloud architecture and you know I also mostly you know observability tools like I'm using in the current project is like uh Promethis and Graphana and these things. So we also working for the AI and you know data pipelines which managing uh which managing the secure outposts for handling data and sensitive models.
Derek Dicks: Welcome.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So this is this allows uh me to to ensure the devops and ensure reliability uh repeatedly and complaints to the meta. So I've been part of the team uh where working uh you know provision GP enabling co-op and discussions and automation deployments for ML models. So as of that I also as the working as a microservices uh with implementing the blue green with canary strategies uh for uh safe modes. So I passionate about like a building reliable scale and cost optimizing pipelines uh so where I deploy the microservices. So for this I also manage the GPU intensive training jobs and uh also working on the DevOps depth automation skills and hands-on uh machine learning experience.
 
 
00:04:27
 
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So, so these are the things I'm currently using uh for the pattern
Derek Dicks: Excellent. Well, thank you for that. I appreciate that. Um, Evan, I apologize. I probably should let you introduce yourself next. Very good.
Evan Kubicek: Oh, no worries.
Derek Dicks: Sean's here.
Evan Kubicek: Yeah. Know, Jean, now Vishnu, I'm I'm I'm on the sales, marketing, and kind of investment side.
Jean De Lasse: Okay.
Evan Kubicek: I have experience working with engineers previously. So, I understand the challenges that you face and the difficulty of prioritizing what what you're building and try to keep everything up and running everything. So, I know DevOps is definitely an area that we could we could benefit from. So, exciting to kind of hear your background. my what I do doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of what we have to talk about today. So, but that's just yeah that's here just kind of listen in. Um I guess my main question would be is if you could summarize in terms of what would be the biggest business benefit we would get from having you on the DevOps side of things.
 
 
00:05:29
 
Evan Kubicek: So I say Vishnu is going to help us accomplish what? How would you summarize that?
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Uh hello. So you asking question or uh
Evan Kubicek: Yeah. So, if you summarize in terms of what you do, so you you went over a lot of the technical side of what you do, which is great. We want smart people. We have smart people. I would love to know, all right, what impact is that going to actually have on our business? So, you do all your work. What does that get us? How are we better as a company? Because we got you on the team.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Okay. So, so when it comes to the
Evan Kubicek: Explain. Explain it to your grandma. Simp. Just keep it simple.
Derek Dicks: And I will say uh Vishnu I will say if you have a high level uh because you don't actually know our use case so it might be a little impossible to really pinpoint you know the benefits of things but it would be great to have a high level as as Evan's asking uh in a moment Jean on um he can give some more exact you know problems that we're in right now and like some things that we could use that would give maybe you know what actually that'd be much more fair let's Jean would you mind sharing for just a moment um you can introduce yourself and then maybe give a high level view of
 
 
00:06:52
 
Derek Dicks: kind of where we're at uh g give poor Vishnu a moment to be able to collaborate with himself and uh figure out what he thinks that he can do to be able to help us out with this I have some of my own ideas but I'd love to hear um I'd love to hear directly from you
Jean De Lasse: Yeah, absolutely. Uh, Vishnu, thank you. Uh, thank you for taking the time. Sorry I was late. Um, yeah, like Derek said, there are a couple of fires going on uh that we do need help with.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Okay.
Jean De Lasse: And, uh, personally, what stands out from your resume is your ability to scale and automate, uh, uh, you know, the CI/CD uh, side of things, right?
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Yeah.
Jean De Lasse: We most of what we have is uh you know got to be honest with you it's monolithic code that does what it's supposed to do but it was not initially intended to be shared right these were um you know these were solo dev things that I had going on and and and Derek contacted me and I agreed to pretty much um it was over time but it was it was a situation where I kind of stopped my agency um for a moment right I I I did have a couple things going on and that's why these are um uh they're they're much more modular now obviously to to to be shared but uh we have
 
 
00:08:13
 
Jean De Lasse: uh right now we have a unified inbox right that is our that is one of our flagship projects right and you know looking at your resume see I see you have strong AWS experience this this unified inbox that that we have it has well it has multiple databases right it has a posgress uh well a SQL database to save messages from one platform and then we're proxying another platform through uh you know uh you know through
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Yeah.
Jean De Lasse: just the middleware there and then we're doing our own proprietary one so this unified inbox that's basically what it is right so the client say uh gets all of their channels in a in just one UI one clean UI Facebook, Instagram, web chat, SMS. Okay. And we're doing the um like I said, we're proxying uh we're proxying currently a white label. Okay. A white label software that provides us with um all of the endpoints for the chat. Okay.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Okay.
Jean De Lasse: Uh it's your it's your typical chatbot provider that has easy integrations, all that.
 
 
00:09:27
 
Jean De Lasse: Uh the point where we're at is that we're migrating to proprietary, right? Uh so we're doing basically our own version. Um since we just have uh I got to be I got to say it like that even if it sounds a little bit arrogant. We have uh bigger ideas than what the software is allowing us to to deliver, right? Um and that's what we're working towards. Uh right, we're uh we're talking about um a simple AI that you can just simply send a voice and this is where we are by the way, not not the idea. Um but where we are right now is a simple voice message, right? or any any channel, any channel for the input. And you say, "Hey, April, I wanted to get um 200 companies in my in my, you know, in my caller, in my auto caller for tomorrow, and I want you to call all of them, and I want you to basically transfer anyone to me that's interested.
 
 
00:10:25
 
Jean De Lasse: And all of the other ones, just put them on a on a campaign where we email them every day, right?" And so um this is so you know this is essentially uh then going to be displayed for me in my in my dashboard right oh a new task was initiated and this service was called this many leads came in uh I I made these many calls and so this is the the the the dashboard right that's the second part of our inbox for our client is the dashboard the inbox is really to see what happened during those interactions right? My agents were out there doing stuff and I want to see what they said. So, I want to go to this inbox and that's where where we're at. Um, that being said, all that context being said, um, I wanted to ask uh, you know, so this is be this is going to be designed to to handle well hundreds of thousands of of conversations and we do need to keep it compliant, right?
 
 
00:11:28
 
Jean De Lasse: SOCK 2 compliant, GDPR compliant. Um, I guess what would your approach be to to make sure that it it's it scales correctly? Like what would you review from the code to make sure it scales correctly to to high volumes? Uh, like where would you start?
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Yeah, that's an interesting question is no. So for like you know so basically like you know as per my uh experience on the both like uh like the cloud as DevOps as well. So, so here the you know uh DevOps and AI. So, so what I can think is uh mostly so in these situations like you know first we will ensure the uh stateless services like uh I will use the message cues like uh you know uh or even streams like Kafka to decouple the injection. So it's for the processing design uh which for you know database scaling. So, so basically for data I will review how the postgress is like you know used so which ensuring the index connectors fails and possible introductions and also for the read replicas or shading as a volumes.
 
 
00:12:44
 
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So this is at the code level. So I would review the and I was also you know review the like you know API handlers to aid the synchronous bottlenecks check query efficiency uh so and I also you know ensure the implementation of messenger handling since the GDPR complex is required. So I would like you know I would like to uh you know uh confirm the encryption at rest and in transit uh possible retention like that and so and also here that we have the it depends on the you know basic access control for the sensitive conversation. So and so finally I will I would validate scalability with you know road testing to hundreds of thousands of uh you know concurrency and versionions and I will also check uh like AML for like uh you know which uh you know I will separate model interface from the main API traffic like that and I will use the model service uh services like you know interfaces with HPA or VPA and also do some monitoring AI specific things like uh for example like you know from the core perspective like I will check interference logic uh you know and also you know operation batching so where possibly and model operations like uh worked on.
 
 
00:13:57
 
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So here it would be go for the latency on the complaints for the set GPR means like you know uh ensuring the data passed uh which uh which into the model 6 NMR like that and we have like you know anonymously uh encrypted and also you know delable and also keep for more model versioning so we can explain what version of model uh you know made a decision so finally I implemented the observability you know not just a health system uh it's like the uh mostly uh so but also a monitoring interface it's like so we hear the latency accurac and we also hear like drift and data seek like that so that way we can handle hundreds of thousands of uh you know uh conversations while staying compliment and complaint and making a output reliable. So here we can get the outputs available and trustworthy.
Jean De Lasse: Okay. Fantastic. Fantastic. Uh okay. So these three sources that we have so far are going to get expanded obviously. Uh they're they're uh again our route is to a fully proprietary.
 
 
00:15:05
 
Jean De Lasse: We're uh we're very close. Uh this is literally the last step. This is uh really just the um the sign of everything that's going to happen on the front end. Um how it's going to be connecting to you know we're thinking uh not everything needs to be uh proprietary. Um there are there are things that we that we're planning on implementing at the API level only right like uh we're thinking of using uh go high level right are you familiar with go high level by any chance it's this uh CRM software yeah it's the yeah so um you know this at at that level it it is uh it does become a little bit uh a little bit of a buy versus build situation where where
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Oh yeah.
Jean De Lasse: that could offer, you know, they do offer on their version two of the API, they do offer plenty of things that, you know, an an AI agent can can harness to to get a lot of stuff done and and and we can piggyback off of their storage for a lot of things, off of their compute time, off of their, you know, uh we can offset a lot to them uh for for very low cost.
 
 
00:16:14
 
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Yeah, that's correct.
Jean De Lasse: Obviously they they they also have this data um what's it called the u fair fair fair use pol fair usage policies right that they'll have that obviously we'll have to to uh do the math for that we need
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good.
Jean De Lasse: break rate limiting um but yes that's uh sorry I I was just going to say you know this this inbox that we have right now it uses a combination of websocket connections for for this uh white label software along with uh rest apis Right.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Yeah.
Jean De Lasse: Um so it is a combination now. It is a little bit of a of a of a you know of a Frankenstein. Um but it uh you know it is it is working. So the next step here would be to merge these conversations, right? Uh we're thinking of a dduplication system where the AI basically by confirming, you know, using a key identifier, your basic email, your basic phone number, maybe even a combination of of uh address and name or any of these.
 
 
00:17:26
 
Jean De Lasse: Once uh we've uh identified the user, we should uh merge these conversations, right? Go high level does have natively a dduplication feature but we're thinking on expanding on it right we're thinking on the inbox itself should um should automatically by the AI uh you know be able to to display these merged
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Nothing.
Jean De Lasse: conversations right the function would be very simple dduplication match uh occurs right we have a maybe score-based system if it's going to be something nondeterministic like we were also thinking like the AI could have since we have it uh with memory which is another big part of what we're uh solving. Um so this this long-term memory would um actually help you know get this uh get this um well get this web socket ready to have the conversation merged in real time and have all the sources from all the
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Yeah. Can I Can I Can I add a sentence if you don't mind?
Jean De Lasse: platforms and just one single thread. Right? That is that is the next challenge.
 
 
00:18:33
 
Jean De Lasse: Sorry.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So can I add a sentence if you don't mind like you know so like so basically like using the go you know high level API layer it's a smart mode so you know where I can help in make
Jean De Lasse: Yes, of course.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: sure you know those APIs interactions make sure that you know our production at the scale with automation mounting alerts and you know so on the top of that you know I would also focus on enabling a service on these messages such as bash to you know like a text text transactions like that. So and also we have the sentiment analyst and intent classifications. So here so so mostly the the platform is not just for aggregating messages but also giving intelligence insights to your clients. So that's uh you know that's where a cloud and devops practice combined. So we can ensure the platform scales and make sure you know uh so mostly it would be implementing a a driven entry resolutions and also service instead of like a you know so just exact match email or phone.
 
 
00:19:36
 
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So I would use a combination of identifiers as a you know as a uh mostly you know belongs to the same user. So for example if a phone matches treated as a high confidence uh uh like that. So here the similar names and address mode uh you know the model would be flagged uh tri triggered over there. So you know along that here we can technically these services can run a micros service uh where uh along like you know so events like via kafka or websockets like that. So then writing you know so for mostly uh when it comes to writing a back and identify user id so that the way agents always see one measure uh to see the you know uh see one measure threats
Jean De Lasse: Yes.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: per user like Okay.
Jean De Lasse: Okay. Got it. Uh and what's your uh what's your what's your type of background with uh this this uh pretty much the closed loop of of you know we're trying we're really it would be very very helpful this closed loop uh you know test first approach like first we design the tests that we want it to pass and then we develop around that.
 
 
00:20:45
 
Jean De Lasse: uh like uh obviously uh just how comfortable would you be if we uh share the entire codebase of this unified inbox and basically bring you uh bring you as uh you know as a co co-developer here co co-head of uh development what would be your um your position there what were your thoughts
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Okay. My background you know comp combines like a cloud devops and you know AI so blend. So I build the scalable uh you know mostly the you know I build like mostly scalable Kubernetes platforms and AWS services and this working on mostly the board models into the production I also supported the real-time messaging system so where uh you know that that would be like uh like you know both duplication complex so I can bring both infrastructure side and these sides like mostly so I also do you know as entity regions on uh model development and uh like that and we also working like you know I can think really help the clouds loop so we are building uh you know we are building these uh you know such data like that so this like you know I also the co-developer with the unified uh you know inboxes and these kind of things so mostly so I also have the bringing the structure setting up uh tests and also working on the like
 
 
00:22:09
 
vishnumolakala badarinadh: you know driving like a compliances and the cloud devops background to strength the uh platform where we can you know doing these things uh for mostly so while the collaborating closely on precious so I also you know uh review the uh their complaints so yes I would be glad to step in as a technical uh cooling head you know drive project uh uh for forward like that
Jean De Lasse: Okay. Okay. Thank you. Sounds great. I just have two two more questions. I I uh top of my mind. uh and and with your uh uh uh curriculum here uh you uh I see data dog and monitoring and you also mentioned a lot of obser observability tests um how would you well it's actually how would you uh
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Yeah.
Jean De Lasse: implement some some uh some really really comprehensive error tracking for this system that you know it has external APIs uh it has um you know the websocket connection it has proxy to go high level proxy APIs to um this other wide label for the chat messaging system.
 
 
00:23:16
 
Jean De Lasse: um if it all of a sudden started returning mixed up conversations between say uh different channels or different businesses you know how would how would we be you know first of all how how soon do you think even without looking at the codebase I know that it's actually kind of hard to to estimate but um in your experience how long does it usually take to have uh this comprehensive debugging right uh to to debug an issue like This of mixed up conversations.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Yeah. like uh you know so when it comes to like so as a like as you discussed like you know before like you know briefly previously so we working on some monitoring tools like proitis and graphing these tools like you know for but for this like you know for the API layer I work with the I go with the you know mostly for you know compliances like like error tracking strategy like a wrap of external APIs calls uh with this so so here like would be like you know we we we have to request the response response page like a mask or ps like like that.
 
 
00:24:25
 
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So and yes uh here would be like you know we also hardpinks to detect the dropping uh uh conversations like that and we are the for the comprehensives so we have the logic for the log connection life so for I also enforce the scheme of value so that where we can the business logics I will track the business logic too and for that I use like you know I would like to you know conversation that can't mix across the tenets or channels and the observative tools so for that we are using like side I will use the data rock for distribution and tracing and when it comes to the you know is there any real time things so we are also using like you know we would also define SLOs's from the most of the sector so for this so we have the so example like we have ensure the 1% of the conversations like would be like uh mostly like in the uh first so you know the first percent of conversations are mismatched from the 100%. So here like we have like some kind of uh one the mismatch areas like 100 it would be like that and we have like mostly on the logic side and PK 100k plus messages.
 
 
00:25:34
 
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So and also finally like you know I also doing like uh I can also do like I would apply based anomaly detection uh sector here. uh and also you know for taking the uh uh anomaly detection to surfaces and these kind of things and we also automated the reconnection the logic for the log connection recycle events and uh uh decoupleization over there like that and we also having like uh you know so it would be like a basic framework where we can work it on so patterns and these things so it would be like could be the stood up in the first week and also uh it was basic like from the last week to like update update and fully robust. So AI assist mostly the monitoring you know systems where we can would be the really uh about a month like that.
Jean De Lasse: Okay.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So here uh most of most of the the calls API things and these things are we are working on like a distribution and this kind of data uh for this position
Jean De Lasse: Understood.
 
 
00:26:37
 
Jean De Lasse: I appreciate the the thorough response. Yeah, I think uh I think yeah, I think I covered pretty much uh the biggest uh areas of what is currently, you know, our our most immediate needs uh uh are and and pretty much what is our our um one of our flagship uh projects, right? Not not the only one. Uh but this definitely at this at this juncture it is it is uh it is a priority. Um yeah I I I uh I like what I heard. Um you know the system is coming together nicely and I think your structure and experience would be a great asset. That's uh you know that's that's that's my view. I don't know uh if you guys have more more questions or want to go through
Derek Dicks: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Sean. Um John, would you be able to to make this a better question as far as regarding um our compliance process right now? uh as far as if he um you know how to assess um his connection point with it or experience with it or if that would be something that we'd want him to review.
 
 
00:27:52
 
Jean De Lasse: Yes. Uh no he did mention already um some protocols and some some frameworks about keeping for example data encrypted at rest and in transit and and the things that are required from the code side of things. Um what this would allow I guess you know very immediately I see the opportunity that this would allow us to um have have you Bishnu uh start working with me on the code with with the other uh devs with the other guys and um whether that's myself uh well actually me and Derek will have to take care of the documentation side of things the huge pile of of uh of of documentation that needs to be done uh to to really have you know it's just all the screenshots all the uh all the proof that the you know we're rotating our APIs that we're you know that we're doing all these things um uh yeah we're we're at we're at a stage where we're preparing for type one uh you know sock 2 type one which is just uh you know the initial phase and then we're going to be set up for a for a for for a period of time where observability and and you know, we're going to have to keep a lot keep up with their uh with their requests uh for the audit.
 
 
00:29:12
 
Jean De Lasse: Um so I guess yeah a question could be uh how involved have you been with those type of deployments where you know there is a priority even if it's not sock 2 or or GDPR maybe it could be some something different right like HIPPA but primarily uh this since this is where we are how how much of a necessity has it been for the code that you build I mean they we they always say right uh you have to build code like somebody's watching because if it's going to scale then somebody will. Um so what is your experience there with sock 2 compliance as far as as far as the code base?
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So I've been heavily involved you know uh in the you know complaint like like that. So mostly uniclo so compliance as a core requirement including the shock uh variance and like so here the where every system variances like also included s2 gdpr hippo like environments I was involved before uh in the current project uh like that so where every system change has been audible and traceable uh here in this so where uh so here uh I can do like where uh the every strategy and monitoring systems uh using the we are using like a docker and uh prom and the graffan and these kind of things.
 
 
00:30:33
 
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So I also access access across all the control system for that and we also have the GDPR and these things I impacted a role based access control and IM policies I worked on the mostly here and we have also like system you know requests like that for the it's mostly the zero period in the healthare system we worked on the bio so as uh we are we have the we have the infrastructure host uh hello Hello.
Derek Dicks: Yeah, I can hear you.
Jean De Lasse: Yeah. No, I I I still hear you. Yep.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: What happened?
Jean De Lasse: Oh, I guess you you lost our audio.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Hello.
Jean De Lasse: Yeah. Can you hear us? Hello. Hello.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Oh, hello. What happened? So, oh, you guys can hear me.
Evan Kubicek: We can hear you if you can hear us.
Derek Dicks: Yeah, I can still hear you. I don't know if you can hear me or not, but I can hear you fine.
 
 
00:31:34
 
Jean De Lasse: Yep.
Derek Dicks: Yeah.
 
 
Session ended after 00:32:02
 
00:33:37
 
Derek Dicks: No, it was funny. I could hear you uh before, but yeah, I could tell it was breaking on your side that Okay, perfect.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So suddenly my voice and the video is breaking like part by part. So I was confused. So where we have like you know and uh the observative side right. So yeah, so so basically in my experience uh at Meta so I use a you know so I supported the deployment uh and where so where complaints were not negotiable like that and here the GDPR and Europe mostly so and h health and the healthcare like that so so that means the building pipelines where uh where every deployment is very fully automated and also you ensuring all the data so we have like putting into the so data was encrypted like that so and we also here putting observability where so that auditors put the uh reference directly like that and so I have so here I'm comfortable to working on the environment uh you know so where compliances drives architecture like that so mostly the weather the GDPR is so gar like that mostly so these kind of things or you're even if you are in the inbox uh same data like that mostly the unified
 
 
00:35:04
 
vishnumolakala badarinadh: inbox so I will apply the same thing and we also make sure the logs audit is uh uh and I also working on the pointer like that not not just engineering so but also you know aing permits too
Jean De Lasse: Got it.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Yeah.
Jean De Lasse: That's fantastic. Yeah, that's um you know that that insight is uh is so valuable in my opinion. um everyone's uh everyone's after the uh big clients, but then they're hit with the compliance side of things, even more so when integrations come into play and third parties and fourth parties. So that is that is something that's um going to be really valuable um for us and um yeah uh I guess uh another question we had is um you know we uh we would benefit a lot from the
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Oh.
Jean De Lasse: structure that comes from uh pretty much having uh you know not necessarily that we need to go and acqu and get uh Jira and all the uh all the you know uh ticketing systems and and so on. But we do we do have a need for a little bit more of the scrum methodology right to be able to have um beginning of of projects and assignments need to be cleared out a little bit more.
 
 
00:36:31
 
Jean De Lasse: uh we're working towards that but I wanted to ask you uh as well we're thinking of you know of a separate aspect here of uh of the things that we would uh you know of the value that that we see you bringing is here on the scrum methodology we're thinking of a of a ratio of maybe you know I I initially thought half and half but um I haven't said something more along the lines of 80 20 80% you fully focused on on the development side. Um, you know, which, uh, there's there's a lot in there. Um, and another portion, another small portion of the time, uh, let's say a couple hours a week or or we'll we'll see about these specifics, right? How comfortable would you be helping was with the uh you know pretty much spearheading the scrum management side of things the accountability for tasks uh you know perhaps assignments uh you know skill related assignments and uh not necessarily you know uh training or anything like that but just simply the oversight of how we're uh putting together this build so that we don't have any issues is like, you know, uh, merge issues or, oh, somebody did a a pull request at a, uh, you know, wrong time and now we're having branch issues and things like that, right?
 
 
00:38:00
 
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Yeah. So, okay.
Derek Dicks: I guess to follow up like how your experience with running teams u versus just being a high level member of a team that would be specifically what I'd like to hear.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So, So I applying for both technical delivery and you know constructor like that. So so my batch you know so my background includes working you know H&DM so like that so agile team and uh with both a jer and structured workforce and but I also you know how to do uh so it lean for lean startups like that. So for for your phase like I would say about uh uh so 80% of uh deployment side and devops work like that and and 25% of scum process alignment. So we have to making sure we just so enough structure to you know track work and deliver uh liability without breaking the process. Hello.
Jean De Lasse: Yes. No. Yeah. Uh I guess uh uh well yeah my question was kind of uh how comfortable you you would be with that assignment and and what has been your experience on on leading or men maybe not mentoring but um have you had direct reports under you uh as far as front end backend or or how how was the uh the collaboration Like Derek said, uh, I think he worded it a lot better.
 
 
00:39:57
 
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So I'm I'm comfortable with that role. So mostly so I even so we are heading the uh these things. So when I was in the meta so I worked on the agile teams. So, so where so where I often helped for the organization skills and planning and these kind of things. So, we also worked on uh organizing like a sprint plannings like tracking uh Jira and KBAN like that. So, so we are having like it could be like happen like smoothly on that time like so where we can follow up this
Derek Dicks: Okay. Yeah, because I think that would be um there's all sorts of things I think that Jean needs to help with on the back side um to get things scalable. Uh so there's some things he specifically said. I think that the two biggest things for me um are that um basically our sock 2 GDPR like the compliance program um you know almost ownership of that Jean's able to get a lot of things done on that we can documentations on it but just you know a true owner to help walk that through and then also even like the the team management um you know being able to be comfortable running standups or you know grooming through the backlog.
 
 
00:41:18
 
Derek Dicks: Um you know helping define ready not ready and like steps along those way like somebody that that can help lift that off Sean's back is I think um he may not say it but that's I think he would benefit from it just to be focused more on one side of things versus him trying to go back and forth and back and forth and help. So somebody to help alleviate some of that pressure off of him to be the sole builder, help him in that way, but then also um take over some of that management side for all the people we have because we have some machine learning people, some data scientists, we have some other consultants that we have on that are good at different platforms and so we have a lot of people available. Um, it's just it, you know, it's a challenge to be 100% in the zone as you're building building building to check out and go assign five different people tasks to make sure they're following up with their tasks, make sure they have clear understanding of it, double check their work, and then jump back in and go back to it's just hard for anybody to do that.
 
 
00:42:14
 
Derek Dicks: And that's what Jean's been trying to do all things. Um, so somebody to be a true, you know, right-hand man for Jean to be able to help him out with with where he's at building, but then somebody that can um just look eye to eye to the rest of the team and and keep them focused on task and uh progressing on the different uh tasks they have. Those are my biggest my biggest asks that I'm looking for in addition to what Jean needs to actually be, you know, uh in the trenches with him is a phrase. uh somebody to be, you know, in fully in the project but then also able to come out and help run teams.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Okay.
Derek Dicks: Does that seem like something you'd be comfortable with? Is that does that speak to your experience? Is that something you could talk about?
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Yeah. Yeah, I'm comfortable with that.
Derek Dicks: Okay.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So I completely understand I was glad to step into the role.
Derek Dicks: Oh, go ahead. Sorry.
 
 
00:43:10
 
Derek Dicks: I was gonna give you a chance. Did you Did you
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So so where you know one cut into four like you know so I uh for this position like so especially with the mix of so ML ML engineer like that so and also have the data concept like that. So these things so so my approach will be like you know acting like as you know both sides where you guys like okay so a technical co-lead and and also helping the ascent tasks and these things and also make sure the team members are clear on the deliverables or not and so creeping the branches full pull requests and and code reviews and the flowing smoothly uh and these things so I I can handling uh these things for
Derek Dicks: Okay, great. John, do you think there's anything um and you you can think about this if there's anything that you you would want to hand him as is as u you know just a review test of sorts to see um that that's up to you on that side.
 
 
00:44:13
 
Derek Dicks: Um as far as Vishnu for you um what what is your current uh situation now? I I don't I don't know much. Are you currently employed? Are you uh fully available? What's your bandwidth currently? An interest in teaming up.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Yeah, I'm so mechanic project is ending. So that's why I'm looking for the new roles. So so I can move as soon as possible, you know.
Derek Dicks: Okay. Are you um are you interested in a like a consultant role, like a part-time role, or are you looking for full-time employment?
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So I I look at full-time employment.
Derek Dicks: Okay.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Currently I located in Chicago, Illinois.
Derek Dicks: Where where are you located at?
vishnumolakala badarinadh: I moved to Chicago.
Derek Dicks: Okay. Okay. I'm in southern Illinois, so we're we're in the same state. Okay, great.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Okay.
Derek Dicks: Yeah, Jean, he is in Mexico. Uh, and Evan, he's just north of me. He's closer to you than I am.
 
 
00:45:08
 
Derek Dicks: So most of the team uh the head team is in US B US-based but our devs are all all over the place.
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So I used to work on the forest city uh Charlotte before in the metal office. So uh they give the remote position so that I moved to the Chicago where I started my career.
Derek Dicks: Okay. Okay, great. Um, do you have any current clients that um that you're working with that need to close up or are you are you in between clients or what what's that?
vishnumolakala badarinadh: So no actually the current project is going to end. So that's why you know even I'm looking for the contract uh uh positions like uh where I can work. So so I don't have to nothing to as soon as possible I want to move to the new project uh as my current project is uh ending.
Derek Dicks: Okay, got you. Um, Evan, do you have any other questions on your side? I know, uh, we kind of went off the defend for a little bit, but is it, you know, full circle back to you?
 
 
00:46:06
 
Derek Dicks: Is there anything that you'd like to know or maybe even ask That's
Evan Kubicek: No. Um, no. I think the main things in terms of role alignment and you know capability um and I and you my apologies I have not been able to see any of anything you've submitted over in terms of like um project examples, previous work examples. So Derek Jean, have you guys seen anything from from previous work that we'd be able to kind of look at?
Derek Dicks: a good idea, Sean.
Jean De Lasse: Um, I apologize. I saw the um I saw the curriculum. Um, I uh don't believe you have uh link to any GitHub projects there, right? But um yeah. Uh yeah. No, I guess if if if you have sorry if you have any link to um any sort of portfolio that you have Freddy or a couple of URLs of uh uh that that we could see if not I think you know it's uh it's kind of beyond um beyond that I from my end I um I would send you uh I would send you a couple of files of our of our main repository and uh you know kind of give you a a real life um a real life test of uh one of the things that we're working through.
 
 
00:47:38
 
Jean De Lasse: Um and I would think of another uh you know um another aspect with the uh with the scrum management that would you know in the same percentage and the same percentage ratio that we uh discussed that would include a scrum test for all of our devs, right? That would be a nice way of you to uh get to know them. Um and and have that as a as a kind of next step from from me at least.
Derek Dicks: Okay. Does that sound fine, Vishnu? Do you have a GitHub to to give or portfolio of sorts?
vishnumolakala badarinadh: uh so so I don't have one from my so I can I can Good.
Derek Dicks: I don't Yeah, I don't know if that Jean, that's up to you if you feel like that's something to take time on or if there's
Jean De Lasse: No, no, I I I understand. I understand. Sometimes we don't have time for personal personal projects. Uh like our my Mac isn't, you know, my Mac is mine and I have a Windows computer, but they're full of April projects and my, you know, my personal websites are like so down on the on the timeline.
 
 
00:48:57
 
Jean De Lasse: I I understand if the portfolio is not a you know a thing that you've worked on but um I would I would um yeah like I said I would look at uh like you said if it's as soon as possible that we're also looking to collab collaborate. So a test that is real life and uh related to the project itself I think um would be a a nice a nice way to to continue
Derek Dicks: Okay, that sounds good. I think um Vishnu would probably be good to uh bring this back over to our CEO JD, review everything with him, see if he has any other questions or things that we need to follow up before we move forward with that. Jean, and then also we can discuss um anything that been previously mentioned as far as pay rates and expectations on that side. Um Evan, do you feel like there's anything else before we go?
Evan Kubicek: No, I think that'd be great. Um, just being able to to look at some previous work would be would be good and then um go from there with JD.
Derek Dicks: Okay. Well, I'd like to get something together with JD right away. So, hopefully I can have something back to you um later tonight. I know it's uh it's only one o'clock, so it's not bad. Um hopefully later tonight, but for sure by tomorrow, we'll have something back to you and then hopefully have another meeting set right away and we can uh reconvene and go over all the details. That sound good?
vishnumolakala badarinadh: Yeah, that's good.
Derek Dicks: Okay. Well, great. We'll plan for um I know tomorrow I have a lot of meetings that we're doing, so I'll find a time that can work out um and then send you some options and we can try and get back together tomorrow uh at latest. So, thank you everybody for coming and joining.
